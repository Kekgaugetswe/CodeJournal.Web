# CodeJournal – Frontend (Angular)

## ✨ Overview

**CodeJournal** is a personal development blog and journal where I document my growth as a software engineer, share insights, and allow others to engage through comments, encouragement, and support.

This is the **Angular-based frontend** of the platform. It interfaces with the CodeJournal API and serves a clean, responsive UI with features like post rendering, comment threads, and category-based filtering.
